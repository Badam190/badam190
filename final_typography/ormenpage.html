 <h1> What is David Bowie's Blackstar Really About? </h1>

   <p class="first paragraph">But that ISIS comment, relayed second-hand, is about all anyone's got for now about the intentions and meaning of Blackstar from its author: Bowie doesn't give interviews anymore. Which you might call frustrating, except for the fact that Blackstar could lose some of its considerable magic were it ever fully explained by its creator. Attempting to interpret its mystery, on your own, is part of the appeal.
  </p>

  </br>
  <p>
  His 2013 comeback record, The Next Day, collected short pop-rock jams you could throw onto a playlist; Bowie's 25th full length offers seven epics of alternately terrifying and spellbinding jazz instrumentation over which Bowie bellows phrases like "The blackout hearts the flowered news / With skull designs upon my shoes" and somehow makes them catchy. Two interconnected music videos from a Breaking Bad director have preceded it, featuring people convulsing rhythmically, like GIFs, and Bowie crooning from under a burlap blindfold. Fully understanding may be futile, but understand one must try.</p>

  </br>
  <p>
  So let's. That grand, freaky opener "Blackstar" has two interlocking sections. There's a refrain where Bowie sounds solemn and a bit frightened as he describes the worship of a candle, the power of someone's eyes, and "the day of execution." And then there is even a cheekier-seeming riff filled with brags and insults as such a high, distorted voice in the background squeals "I'm a blackstar" and modulations on it: "I'm not a filmstar," "I'm not a marvel star," "I'm not a pop star." There's also this: "You're a flash in the pan / I'm the great I Am." To whatever extent these lyrics can be summarized, they are about worship, ambition, and ascendance; and more than anything, the great allure and power of being "at the center of it all." </p>
  
  </br>
  <p>
  To me, it's the sound of someone gaining significance by insisting upon their significance; someone hungering to be above, unique, and immortal; someone awing the rest of mankind by standing apart from it. It's about ego, and about how indulging one’s ego can, paradoxically, inspire others to forget their own. You can see how radical clerics and suicide bombers fit the dynamic here.
  But you can also imagine how David Bowie might as well. The album will be released on his 69th birthday. Could the celestial body of the title be the same force that has animated a career as extreme, as willful, as self-directed, and as influential as the one he has led? Alternately, is he himself the blackstar?

  The second song, “'Tis a Pity She's a Whore,” is a jazz-rock freakout, with a loud, galloping low end and animalistic peals up high. Bowie's Facebook page says it addresses the horror of WWI, and at some level it probably does (“That was patrol / this is the war” is a great line with zillions of applications). But vanity might be in there, too. It also borrows its title from a 1600s tragedy about an incestuous romance; the single art features Bowie looking at his reflection in a hand mirror. “Man, she punched me like a dude,” he opens, which may or may not be especially significant coming from pop culture’s great avatar of androgyny.
  After that comes “Lazarus,” the slow-billowing title song for Bowie’s off-broadway musical revisiting The Man Who Fell to Earth. Though sung from the point of view of that play’s displaced alien, you can also imagine the human who’s lived as Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane and so many others—whose many rebirths have made him as enduring an icon as music has ever produced—relates:
</p>

</br>
<p class=lyrics>
Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now
</p>

</br>
<p>
Again and again on Blackstar, Bowie sings as someone whose achievements have wowed mankind while separating him from it, and who regards that separation with a mixture of pride and pain. The music conveys that mixture quite powerfully. Bowie's studio crew for the album, the Donny McCaslin Quartet, sometimes perform quick, shocking changes that generate waves of anxiety; on “Sue,” Bowie sings of (maybe) romantic failure and the band patters restlessly.
