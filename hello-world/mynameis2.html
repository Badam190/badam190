<h1> The Characters </h1>
<img src="img/adameve.png" />
<p> Adam and Eve are the two main characters in the film. Adam is a dark, romantic, and possibly suicidal character who always has the convenience of blaming the humans, a.k.a. zombies, for his misery. Eve is a curious, loving, and appreciative character. They both live on opposite ends of the world but they have been in love for a few centuries being that they're vampires. They balance each other's energies and understand one another. </p>

<p> The characters are based off of Mark Twain's last novel, The Diaries of Adam and Eve. </p>
